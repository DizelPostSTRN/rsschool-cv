# About Me:
##### At the moment, I work at the enterprise as a CNC Operator and am engaged in the manufacture of parts according to the programs I wrote in CNC and NC systems - these are programming systems for machine tools and their additional components and modules. I have been working here for about 10 years. For all the time he has written more than 2000 executive programs for plasma installations such as ESAB, BaltSystems, Burny. I also reconfigured the control drives and actuators in software. Prior to that, he worked at another enterprise in the engineering field, where he gained skills and experience in working with operating racks of Fagor and Siemens CNC coordinate machines.
##### From 2010 to the present, I have been actively developing myself in the direction of Forex (financial markets) - I trade, develop software advisors and signalers, based on indicators of world trade and the economy. I also do systemic, technical and fundamental market analysis. Sometimes I advise beginners in this field. He had experience in network marketing and was engaged in targeted advertising, started on the seosprint website, later set up advertising on VK and Facebook. There is also understanding in some areas of small business.
##### In 2011 I tried to work with MySQL. Since about 2012, I have been mastering the direction of freelancing in various IT areas. Since 2013, he has worked with SAP and 1C - mainly a WAREHOUSE - storage and distribution of materials, products, blanks, drawings and specifications, their quantity and use. Since 2018, I began to study HTML, CSS. Later I developed this direction and since 2020 I tried myself as a freelancer - I was engaged in layout and styles (HTML, CSS, Figma). Later he completed courses in the online school ITiLogiya in this direction. In November 2021, I completed the course on design/landing from the Logomachine resource. Also, from the beginning of 2020, he showed interest in the Python programming language and its Django framework, began to study it on his own, using video courses and literature. In December 2021, he completed advanced studies at the OverOne online school. I am currently working on several projects. Some of them are on GitHub (https://github.com/DizelPostSTRN) I also came across CI \ CD technology, I understand the PyCharm and Visual Studio Code environments, I worked a little with JS and React. I have knowledge of the English language, currently I continue to study it (courses, tutorials), I visit a tutor. On September 4, 2021, I attended the meetup, where I discovered new opportunities for myself in my training - these are Machine Learning, Deep Learning; also began to study some commented material for further application in practice. In 2022, he completed an internship at IBA Group (Gomel) as a Python developer.
